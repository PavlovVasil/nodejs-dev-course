# Console node.js app

Run the app by opening a terminal in the console-weather-app directory and typing:  
```node app.js```, followed by a city name. If the name contains more than one word, it has to be inside quotes in order for node to parse it as a string.  
For example:  
```node app.js "New York"```  
```node app.js Chicago```
